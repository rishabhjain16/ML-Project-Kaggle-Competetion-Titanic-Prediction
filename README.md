# ML-Project-Kaggle-Competetion-Titanic-Prediction

## The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Notebook Description
This is a python notebook. It is divided into the following sections: 
1. Load and Import 
2. Data Description 
3. Data Visualisation 
4. Feature Engineering 
5. Model, Fit and Predict

## Result:
This is the first version of this notebook, that includes visualisation and feature engineering, as well as testing different models. So far, I have achieved an accuracy of 79.425%.
